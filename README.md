# Blinkit Data Analysis Using Python 

###  Overview 
This project analyzes sales, outlet performance, and customer behavior using the Blinkit dataset.
The dataset contains 8,523 rows and 12 features, covering product details (item type, fat content, weight), outlet details (size, type, location, establishment year), and performance metrics (sales, ratings).

The analysis focuses on:

1) Data Cleaning (fixing inconsistent values, handling missing data).

2) Business KPI Calculation (total sales, avg. sales, ratings, etc.).

3) Visualization of sales trends across product categories, outlets, and years.

4) Insights & Recommendations for business growth.

### Objectives
1. Clean and preprocess Blinkit dataset for consistency.

2. Calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like total sales, average sales, no. of items sold, and average ratings.

3. Visualize sales distribution across:

   Item fat content,

   Item types,

   Outlet locations,

   Outlet establishment years,

   Outlet sizes and types.

4. Derive business insights to support decision-making.

5. Provide a foundation for building Power BI dashboards and predictive ML models in the future.

### Tool Used
Jupyter Notebook

### DataSet Source 
Kaggle 

### Libraries Used

1. pandas: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis. It organizes raw data into structured DataFrames like Excel tables.

2. numpy: Provides fast mathematical operations on arrays and matrices, making calculations efficient.

3. matplotlib.pyplot: Used for creating basic visualizations like line, bar, pie, and scatter plots with full customization.

4. seaborn: Built on matplotlib, it creates beautiful, statistical charts (heatmaps, distributions, regression plots) with minimal code.

### Features Of The Project 
1. Data Cleaning – Fixed inconsistent entries (low fat, LF → Low Fat, reg → Regular).
2. Business KPIs – Calculated sales and ratings statistics.
3. Visualizations – Interactive plots (bar, pie, line, grouped charts).
4. Insights Extraction – Identified patterns across outlets and products.
5. Scalable Setup – Can be extended to Power BI dashboards & ML predictions

### Business KPIs Results

1. Total Sales: ₹1,201,681.5

2. Average Sales per Item: ₹141.0

3. No. of Items Sold: 8,523

4. Average Ratings:  4.0
